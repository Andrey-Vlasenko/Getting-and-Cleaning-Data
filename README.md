# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Project content:

* CodeBook.md - CodeBook
* run_analysis.R  - R script with comments (It ask you to choose working directory and then do everything itself).
* result.txt - file with results of the step 5 (you can find it in your working directory after run the script).



The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following.

    0. Dowloading and unziping the files (if they doesn't exist in working directory)
    1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
